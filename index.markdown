# About Me
<img src="/assets/img/ShannonFluellen.jpeg" width="300"/>

I'm a software engineer in Houston, TX with 6.5 years of professional experience in enterprise software development.
I've gained experience working with a variety of technologies and languages such as Java, Javascript, NodeJS, and Objective-C.
I've worked on projects as both a part of Agile teams and as the sole engineer. I'm looking for a remote position at a
company where I can make a significant impact.
