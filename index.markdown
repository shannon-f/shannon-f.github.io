I'm a software engineer in Houston, TX with 10 years of professional experience in full stack web and iOS software development.
I've used a variety of technologies and languages such as Swift, Java, Javascript, NodeJS, and Objective-C.
I've worked on projects as both a part of Agile teams and as the sole engineer.
